# multilingual-voice-preserver
This project is an open-source system that performs speech-to-speech translation with voice preservation.
It takes spoken input in one language, translates it into another (e.g., English â†’ Spanish), and outputs the translated sentence in the same voice as the original speaker.

The pipeline combines:

ASR (Whisper) â†’ convert speech to text.

MT (M2M100 / MarianMT) â†’ translate text into the target language.

Voice Cloning (RVC / OpenVoice) â†’ generate speech in the speakerâ€™s original voice.

âœ¨ Key Features:

Real-time or batch speech-to-speech translation.

Natural-sounding, identity-preserving voice cloning.

Modular design (swap models for ASR, MT, or TTS).

Extensible for multiple languages and voices.

ðŸš€ Goal: Break language barriers while keeping your authentic voice.
